# Purpose of the Schemas Repository

This repository exists to make all released versions of the base schema and its subschemas permanently available. That’s why it’s also referred to as the delivery repository – it serves as the delivery source for the JSON Schema artifacts.

If someone builds software that depends on version `0.2.0` of a specific subschema, that exact version will always remain accessible at the same location. This level of stability can’t be guaranteed for other repositories.
